The **Microservices Development in Java** course is targeted at application developers who want to learn how to develop a scalable application on HCP Cloud Foundry. You will learn about the key challenges of a public cloud application and about the key elements of cloud applications like: microservice architecture, REST services, stateless apps, cloud foundry as a platform, unit and component testing, connecting to backing services (DBs etc), logging and monitoring, etc.

The participants will develop a microservice running on CF@HCP which exposes its API via REST, connects to a persistence backing service and that communicates with another service. Based on an 'empty shell application' the participants build a real cloud application / microservice including testing and logging on the different levels. After the training you will have an idea about which libraries and frameworks are useful / required in that context.

This training focuses on the 'app level', i.e. the backend and how to offer REST services. We do not cover UI5 or other UIs. For an example on how to build an app including UI5, take a look at the [SHINE sample application](https://github.wdf.sap.corp/refapps/shine-cf).

**Positioning and Prerequisites:**
* This course targets beginner to intermediate level Java developers
* We make heavy usage of the **Spring** framework, but focus on explaining important internals
* This course focuses on the **cloud native** level of programming, i.e. we target Java on SAP's Cloud Foundry environment. While there is a lot of overlap in 'how to write good cloud apps in Java', we do not cover specialized environments like XSA, IoT or YaaS which have more specific rules to follow and frameworks they provide.
