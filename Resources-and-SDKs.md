# SDKs
This course focuses on explaining how to write a good microservice and understand the internals that are important. 
There are a few SDKs developed within SAP that provide APIs as well as project templates to make microservice development in certain areas easier and more efficient, e.g. for different scopes and use cases such as IoT, S/4HANA extensions etc. 

## SAP S/4 HANA Cloud SDK

The SAP S/4HANA Cloud SDK is the framework of choice for developing side-by-side extensions for S/4HANA Cloud systems based on the SAP Cloud Platform.

The SAP S/4HANA Cloud SDK provides many out-of-the-box capabilities for integrating S/4HANA and for writing Cloud-native applications in general: 
- an abstraction of the underlying cloud platform environment (Neo & Cloud Foundry) for simple access and as an option to transition to Cloud Foundry,
- a Virtual Data Model (VDM) for ease of programming and simplified communication with the S/4HANA system, 
- resilience with Hystrix to prevent cascading failure,
- continuous integration and delivery (pipeline as code),
- tutorials and project templates.
