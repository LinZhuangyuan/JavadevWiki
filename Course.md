## Classroom
This material is typically used in a **classroom training** and usually taken by a **whole team**. For details on how to request a training for your team see the [course info page](https://jam4.sapjam.com/wiki/show/EGWlK3mtzql9i8c3jVNNgk?_lightbox=true). 

## eLearning for Review and Special Situations
There is also an **eLearning version** of the course with videos for all theory modules as well as exercises and a discussion of the solution code. The intention is to use it as source for review for participants of the classroom course and for special cases / remote locations where a classroom training is not feasible. You can access the online course in SML [here](https://performancemanager5.successfactors.eu/sf/learning?destUrl=https%3a%2f%2fsap%2eplateau%2ecom%2flearning%2fuser%2fdeeplink%5fredirect%2ejsp%3flinkId%3dITEM%5fDETAILS%26componentID%3dDEV%5fMSDEV%5fPA%5fCLOUD%5f1604%26componentTypeID%3dCOURSE%26revisionDate%3d1462439340000%26fromSF%3dY&company=SAP). (Note: The link may not work with Chrome; in that case use Internet Explorer or Firefox).
  
* Note: Unless you are an experienced Java developer **we strongly recommend to do the training in a classroom setting** with an experienced trainer that you can ask when you get stuck - which usually happens. If you have no access to a classroom training, then we recommend to go through the videos together with your team.

## Prerequisites
- **Participants**: This version of the course assumes a **beginner to intermediate level of Java knowledge.** If you are not an experienced Java developer, you can prepare by going through [Test Your Java Knowledge](https://github.wdf.sap.corp/cc-java-dev/cc-coursematerial/blob/master/CoursePrerequisites/README.md#test-your-java-knowledge---are-you-ready-for-the-training) .
- **Trainers**: 
If you want to become a trainer for this course you should be an **experienced Java developer** and know **Spring**.
- **Environment Setup**: Every participant should set up their development environment in advance. This [document](https://github.wdf.sap.corp/cc-java-dev/cc-coursematerial/blob/master/CoursePrerequisites/README.md) describes the installation/configuration steps in detail.
